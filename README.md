# Movie-Recommendation-Engine
Build a movie recommendation engine using collaborative filtering techniques. The recommendation engine should be able to suggest movies that a user is likely to enjoy based on their past movie ratings and the ratings of similar users.
Due to the complexity of this project, it is not possible to provide a complete solution in this forum. However, here is an overview of the steps involved and some code snippets to help you get started:
Step 1: Collecting and Cleaning Movie Data
You will need a dataset of movies, ratings, and user information to build your recommendation engine. One popular dataset is the MovieLens dataset, which contains millions of movie ratings from users. You can download the dataset and import it into a database or a pandas dataframe.
(https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
import pandas as pd

movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')
ratings = pd.read_csv('ratings.csv')
users = pd.read_csv('users.csv')

Step 2: Building a Collaborative Filtering Model
Collaborative filtering is a technique that recommends items to a user based on the ratings of similar users. There are two main types of collaborative filtering: user-based and item-based. In user-based collaborative filtering, the recommendation engine finds users who have similar movie ratings to the target user and recommends movies that those similar users have rated highly. In item-based collaborative filtering, the recommendation engine finds movies that are similar to the movies the target user has rated highly and recommends those similar movies.

Here is an example of building a user-based collaborative filtering model using k-Nearest Neighbors:
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

def build_user_based_cf_model(ratings):
    # pivot the ratings dataframe to get a user-item matrix
    user_item_matrix = ratings.pivot_table(index='userId', columns='movieId', values='rating')

    # fill in missing values with 0
    user_item_matrix.fillna(0, inplace=True)

    # build a k-NN model using cosine similarity
    model_knn = NearestNeighbors(metric='cosine', algorithm='brute')
    model_knn.fit(user_item_matrix)

    return model_knn, user_item_matrix
Step 3: Developing a Web Application or Command Line Interface
Once you have built your recommendation engine, you will need to develop a way for users to interact with it. You can build a web application using a framework like Flask or Django, or a command line interface using a library like Click.

Here is an example of building a Flask web application:
from flask import Flask, request, render_template
import pandas as pd
from recommender import build_user_based_cf_model, recommend_movies

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('home.html')

@app.route('/recommend', methods=['POST'])
def recommend():
    userId = int(request.form['userId'])
    num_movies = int(request.form['numMovies'])

    # load the data and build the model
    movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')
    ratings = pd.read_csv('ratings.csv')
    model, user_item_matrix = build_user_based_cf_model(ratings)

    # get the recommended movies
    recommendations = recommend_movies(model, user_item_matrix, userId, num_movies, movies)

    return render_template('recommend.html', userId=userId, recommendations=recommendations)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

Step 4: Deploying the Recommendation Engine to a Cloud Platform
Once you have built and tested your recommendation engine, you can deploy it to a cloud platform like AWS or Google Cloud. You will need to package your code and dependencies into a container image and deploy it to a container orchestration service like Kubernetes.

Here is an example of building a Docker container for your Flask application:
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt
